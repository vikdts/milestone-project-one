### When I ran my html code through W3C validator I found out my buttons do not work, because I had incorrectly used input as a descendant of a element. This was solved with a button element wrapped in a form with the correct path in action attribute.

# Validator testing

### No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator.

## CSS

### No errors were returned when passing through the official Jigsaw validator.

## ACCESSIBILITY
